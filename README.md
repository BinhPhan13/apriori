## Python implementation of Apriori algorithm 
See the git repository [Efficient-Apriori](https://github.com/tommyod/Efficient-Apriori) for details.
I basically just re-implemented the code with some changes which I think is better.

* To run:
    - Prepare the data file in the same format as those in *data/*
    - Change filename and parameters in *main.py*
    - [i]python -i main.py

**By experiments, I get the same results but *faster time* compare to** [Efficient-Apriori](https://github.com/tommyod/Efficient-Apriori)
